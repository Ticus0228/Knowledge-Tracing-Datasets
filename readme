Student answer sequences are recorded in train.csv and test.csv. We use three rows to represent each student answer sequence, for example:
24
30,32,32,69,69,69,75,75,75,75,75,75,75,75,28,28,28,44,44,35,35,35,14,64
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
The first row is the number of the questions answered. The second is skill id. The third is answer correctly (1) or incorrectly (0).
Besides train.csv and test.csv, other files describe the correspondence between skill id and skill name.

assist0910 and assist15 are processed by [1].
